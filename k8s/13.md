## kubectl exec pod/app-python-N -- cat visits
0: 39
1: 62
2: 43

## Differences
Each pods has a different number of visits, since they are independent of each other.

## Ordering guarantees
Ordering guarantees are unnecessary in this case because each pod doesn't depend on other pods, they don't have any shared states.

## Parallel Operations
use podManagementPolicy: Parallel
